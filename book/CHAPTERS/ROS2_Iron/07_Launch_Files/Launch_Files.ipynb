    "Launch files are an important tool in ROS2. You can think of them as fulfillin the role of a conductor in an orchestra. Each musician (or instrument section) represents an individual ROS2 node, such as a sensor node, a motor controller, or a navigation module. Instead of having each musician start playing randomly, the conductor (launch file) ensures a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Everyone starts together**. The launch file starts multiple ROS nodes at the same time, just like a conductor cues musicians to begin playing together.<br><br>\n",
    "2. **Each musician follows a sheet of instructions**. The launch file defines parameters, like volume (sensor sensitivity) or tempo (publish rate), so each node knows how to behave.<br><br>\n",
    "3. **Sections communicate with each other**. Just like strings, brass, and percussion need to coordinate, ROS nodes need to publish and subscribe to correct topics.<br><br>\n",
    "4. **A rehearsal plan is followed**. The launch file can include other launch files\n",

    "Launch files allow users to start multiple nodes simultaneously, configure parameters, and pass arguments dynamically. Essentially, they provide a structured way to manage complex robotic applications.\n",
