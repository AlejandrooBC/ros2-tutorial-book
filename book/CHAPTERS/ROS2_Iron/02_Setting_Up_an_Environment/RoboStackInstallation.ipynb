    "# Robostack\n",
    "\n",
    "Robostack is a bundling of ROS2 that is available to install for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robostack is easiest to install, because it will install the more annoying ROS2 dependencies like OpenSSL through Conda. It is easy to integrate more complex python libraries for computer vision and machine learning, but that is beyond the scope of these tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation instructions from Robostack can be found [here](https://robostack.github.io/GettingStarted.html), but the instructions are compiled here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Miniforge\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboforge recommends installing Miniforge, which can be downloaded [here](https://conda-forge.org/download/). Select the installer for your system, and click through the screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Click through the installer. Do not change any settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MacOS\n",

    "### Install ROS\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO add instructions to open MiniForge Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Robostack provides both ROS and ROS2 packages through Conda. Setup is the same for installing both.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up your environment, run the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba create -n ros_env python=3.11\n",
    "mamba activate ros_env\n",
    "\n",
    "# remove the defaults channel just in case, this might return an error if it is not in the list which is ok\n",
    "conda config --env --remove channels defaults\n",
    "# this adds the conda-forge channel to the new created environment configuration \n",
    "conda config --env --add channels conda-forge\n",
    "# and the robostack-staging channel\n",
    "conda config --env --add channels robostack-staging\n",
    "# if you want to use Jazzy, also add its own channel:\n",
    "conda config --env --add channels robostack-jazzy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can download ROS from Conda!\n",
    "\n",

    "# Install ros-noetic into the environment (ROS1)\n",
    "mamba install ros-noetic-desktop\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Press `Y` and enter when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can launch our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mamba deactivate\n",
    "mamba activate ros_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO add instructions for installing dev tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test ROS2\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test ROS2 by launching `rviz2`, a visualization program for ROS2.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the prompt says `ros_env`, we are good to proceed. Otherwise, activate your environment again with `mamba activate ros_env`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also check that the networking works by running two nodes at once. Open a second miniforge terminal, and activate your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In one terminal, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\n",
    "```\n",
