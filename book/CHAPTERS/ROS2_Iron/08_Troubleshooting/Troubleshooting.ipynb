   "source": "Debugging in robotics is not just about fixing code, it is about diagnosing complex systems where hardware, software, and communication layers all interact. For example, a motor might not be working as expected (i.e. not moving), but is it the code? The power supply? A faulty wire? In robotics, effective debugging means breaking down the problem and attacking it logically. Taking fundamental steps to guide you through the troubleshooting process can make it more efficient.",

This is why knowing the expected behavior of your system is essential — if you do not know what should happen, it is hard to tell what is broken.
