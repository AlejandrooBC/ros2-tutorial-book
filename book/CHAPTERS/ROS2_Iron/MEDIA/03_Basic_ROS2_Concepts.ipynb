Some of the concepts that you will learn about include nodes, topics, services, actions, and more. Below are a few notes about each. You will dive deeper into each concept by exploring its corresponding subchapter.",

    "**Nodes** are independent processes that perform specific computations, allowing different parts of a robot to operate in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics** are named channels that enable communication between nodes using a publish/subscribe model, where data flows asynchronously from publishers to subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Services** allow for synchronous communication between nodes, enabling them to send a request and receive a response for operations requiring immediate feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions** are another communication type and are used for tasks that take time to complete, offering feedback and goal tracking throughout execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters** allow nodes to dynamically configure settings, enabling adaptive behaviors without modifying the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launch Files** help in organizing and managing multiple nodes by launching them simultaneously with a single command.\n",

    "This is a high-level overview of these fundamental concepts, which we will **explore in greater detail in the following sections**."
