In the following sections of this book, you will be guided through writing ROS nodes. As you do so, it is best to keep in mind a few good practices that will help you build scalable and modular systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Design Nodes with Clear Responsibilities**: Avoid overloading a single node with too many tasks. If your program involves several functionalities working together (as most programs do), divide the subsections of the program into executable components that can be handled by separate nodes.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Write Reusable and Scalable Code**: Ensure your nodes can be adapted to new features or systems.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Effective Debugging**: Write your nodes to provide meaningful feedback during development and runtime.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use Parameters and Configuration Files**: Make your nodes flexible without modifying code for different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these principles, you will not only create functional nodes, but also build a foundation for robotic systems that are easier to troubleshoot, extend, and collaborate on with others."
